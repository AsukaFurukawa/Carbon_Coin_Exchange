| [identity.ts](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-carbon-accounting/blob/master/secure-identities/vault-identity/src/delivery/http/v1/identity.ts) | This TypeScript file contains an `IdentityRouter` class that configures Express endpoints for interacting with user identities in the Vault Identity service. The endpoints allow for creating and updating user identities, with proper validation and error handling.                                                                                                                                               |
| [secrets.ts](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-carbon-accounting/blob/master/secure-identities/vault-identity/src/delivery/http/v1/secrets.ts)   | The given TypeScript file defines an HTTP route handler for managing Ethereum keys in a vault identity service using Express.js. This class sets up POST, GET, and DELETE routes for manipulating the Ethereum keys (create, read, update, delete). It validates input, uses VaultIdentityBackend for persisting secrets, and returns appropriate responses or error messages based on success or failure.            |
| [key.ts](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-carbon-accounting/blob/master/secure-identities/vault-identity/src/delivery/http/v1/key.ts)           | Creates an Express API for handling key-related operations (create, rotate, and retrieve) within the vault-identity package for managing secure identities. Utilizes custom validation on kty parameter, requiring either ecdsa-p256 or ecdsa-p384, with error messages sent via HTTP response codes (400 for bad requests and 409 for conflicts). The backend service for VaultIdentity is injected for data access. |
| [v1.ts](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-carbon-accounting/blob/master/secure-identities/vault-identity/src/delivery/http/v1/v1.ts)             | Manages HTTP API v1 for secure identities application. Implements routing logic for identity, key, token, and secrets endpoints using express.js and express-router. Utilizes Express middleware to enforce authorization requirements for specific routes.                                                                                                                                                           |
| [token.ts](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-carbon-accounting/blob/master/secure-identities/vault-identity/src/delivery/http/v1/token.ts)       | In this file, the developer sets up an Express router for handling requests related to tokens within the `vault-identity` module of the project. The router provides endpoints for creating, renewing, deleting and getting details of a token using asynchronous methods tied to a VaultIdentityBackend service instance. It also handles request validation and logs debug messages for errors.                     |

| [go.sum](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-carbon-accounting/blob/master/fabric/chaincode/datalock/go.sum)               | Blockchain-carbon-accounting`The main purpose of this repository is to develop a decentralized, open-source carbon accounting system using blockchain technology. This system aims to track, verify and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a transparent and efficient manner.The referenced code file you are inquiring about appears to belong to the core module within this architecture, as it resides in the root directory (`blockchain-carbon-accounting/`). While specific details of the file's functionality remain undisclosed, one can infer that it plays a crucial role in the creation and management of Carbon Assets – digital tokens representing real-world carbon emission reductions. This is suggested by the naming convention U, possibly short for Unit, implying it may handle units of measurement or transactional data associated with these carbon assets.This central module interacts seamlessly with other components in the system, such as the Smart Contracts (possibly implemented in Solidity), APIs for external data ingestion, and front-end applications for user interactions. Ultimately, the collective efforts across the codebase will result in a blockchain ecosystem empowering individuals and organizations to combat climate change together. |

It updates the transaction state, stores any resulting data in persistent storage, and returns the processed data to the client if applicable. A separate function retrieves transaction details by its unique identifier from the distributed ledger.                                                                                                                                                   |
| [lock-state.go](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-carbon-accounting/blob/master/fabric/chaincode/datalock/internal/lock-state.go)           | This function set creates and manages lock states on a Fabric blockchain using Go programming language. Functions like `SetLockState`, `isLockStateExists`, and `deleteLockState` manipulate lock state data, while functions such as `getLockStateTxID` and `getAllLockState` retrieve lock state information. The lock state consists of a transaction ID, key, and their index for easy access in the blockchain. These functions enable efficient management of locks within smart contracts.                                                                       |

The functions `putLockState`, `getLockStateTxID`, `isLockStateExists`, `deleteLockState`, and `getAllLockState` are being tested to ensure correct storage and retrieval of transaction IDs associated with lock states in the mock chaincode stub. Additionally, the code verifies that lock states and lock indices are being correctly mapped in the state database.                                                                                                            |

These datasets are essential for analyzing the carbon footprint across various industries within the European Economic Area.Moreover, the file also houses utility data such as Conversion Factors, which help convert the raw data into meaningful carbon emission measurements. These files play a vital role in accurate and reliable carbon accounting calculations. By leveraging these datasets, businesses can effectively monitor their environmental impact, track progress, and make informed decisions towards reducing their carbon footprint. |
| [fabricRegistry.ts](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-carbon-accounting/blob/master/fabric/typescript_app/src/service/fabricRegistry.ts)     | In this TypeScript file, a class `FabricRegistryService` is defined which uses the Fabric gateway for registering and enrolling users on a blockchain network. The service accepts inputs via a user-supplied object (`Input`) and validates these inputs using Joi schemas to ensure they have the required fields. In case of any errors or failures, appropriate exceptions are thrown. If the input is valid, the corresponding function `register()` or `enroll()` is called on the Fabric gateway instance, passing in necessary parameters such as user IDs and secrets. The enrollment process includes both registering (i.e., creating a new user identity) and enrolling (i.e., retrieving the users public key and associated certificate).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The Methane module seems to be concerned with data related to methane emissions, which is one of several gases tracked for carbon accounting purposes. This particular implementation could handle operations such as processing input data, analyzing trends, or even calculating emissions footprints based on provided factors – all contributing towards a transparent and accurate blockchain-based carbon accounting system.Bear in mind that this is an overly simplified interpretation without the specific details of what exactly methane' stands for within this project.

| [marbles02.go](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-carbon-accounting/blob/master/fabric/multi-cloud-deployment/chaincode/marbles02.go) | In the Blockchain Carbon Accounting repository, a significant portion of the codebase is organized in an app directory with various subdirectories for different components such as api-oracle, api-server, frontend, methane, reports, scripts, and supply-chain. This architecture suggests that the application has several distinct services for different functionalities including oracle, server, user interface, carbon accounting tools (e.g., methane), data reporting, scripts, and blockchain-related operations in the supply chain component.The data directory appears to hold CSV files and Excel spreadsheets that likely represent emissions data, conversion factors, utility data, or other critical information required for carbon accounting purposes. This highlights the data-driven nature of the application, where precise data management is crucial for its functioning.Among these folders, we will be focusing on `app/reports/generate_emission_report.js`. This JavaScript file seems to serve a vital role within the Blockchain Carbon Accounting system, as it presumably generates an emissions report by compiling and processing data from different sources. The critical features of this code include handling data extraction, calculations based on conversion factors or other input parameters, and generating output in the appropriate format, which could be an HTML report, PDF, or even CSV files. The emissions report likely serves as a critical artifact for carbon accounting purposes, helping organizations track their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and contribute to environmental sustainability initiatives. |
